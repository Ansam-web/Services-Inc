## ðŸ“Œ Introduction 
Services-Inc is a leading company in the field of providing business and home IT services. The 
company provides various IT services in terms of networking, Wi Fi, PC and laptop maintenance, 
printing machines maintenance, and so forth. The company has large number of service 
employees that provide IT services based on pre-determined work schedule. 
Currently, the company keeps their information scattered in Excel sheets and Google sheets for 
every department. The information is duplicated, scattered and presents serious problems in terms 
of generating reports and information access. The company management has finally decided to go 
through the important step of having new software system to manage all company departments, 
service employees, business processes, maintenance, customer relationships, and so fourth. 

## General Background 
The current system operated at Services-Inc is mostly manual, with some Excel sheets and 
Google sheets that are operated by the management, sales, HR, and maintenance. All other 
business process and workflows are operated using manual documents. For instance, when a 
customer asks for a maintenance service at his company, the receptionist fills a hard copy form of 
the customer information, address, and problem description, then sends it to the maintenance 
department. On the other hand, all employeesâ€™ information is kept in the HR department using 
Excel sheets, recording their vacations, sick leaves, salary payments, and so forth. Our customer 
records are kept as both Excel and hard copy documents, which requires lots of time and effort to 
process this information. The maintenance department deals with so many hardware parts, and 
sometimes they run out of certain parts without knowing so. This, in turn can cause long delays in 
delivering maintenance services to our customers and thus affecting customer satisfaction. 
Companies are one part of our customers, other customers are individual customers who purchase 
computers, pretrial devices, or ask for maintenance services. The maintenance department offers 
their services mostly at customer companies and homes. Many times, we find it difficult to 
manage these services in terms of creating efficient schedules that can better utilize our service 
employees and their cars. Further, the only way our customers can contact us is through 
telephones, and this is very cumbersome.
